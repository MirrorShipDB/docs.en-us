## What is DorisDB

* DorisDB is a modern high-performance distributed relational analysis database that has been tested in a variety of data analysis scenarios. It has a simple architecture and vectroized engine. It is MySQL compatible, high scalability, high availability and easy to operate.

* DorisDB is designed to satisfy multiple data analysis scenarios. It supports multiple data warehouse schemas(flat tables, pre-aggregations, star or snowflake schema), multiple data import methods (batch and streaming) and allows direct access to data from Hive, MySQL and Elasticsearch without importing.

* DorisDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol. You can use the MySQL client and common BI tools to connect to DorisDB for data analysis.

* DorisDB is designed as a distributed system. Data can be divided horizontally and stored in multiple replications. The cluster can be easily scaled-out to support 10PB-level data analysis. It supports massively parallel processing (MPP), and has fault tolerance.

* DorisDB adopts relational models, adopts strict data types, adopts a columnar storage engine, and reduces read-write amplification through encoding and compression techniques. 

## Main features

### Simple architecture
DorisDB does not rely on any external systems. The simple architecture makes it easy to deploy, maintain and scale out.

### Completely vectorized engine
  - DorisDB adopts vectorization technology to make full use of the parallel computing power of CPU, achieving sub-second query returns in multi-dimensional analyses.

### Query optimization
  - DorisDB can optimize complex queries through CBO (Cost Based Optimizer). With a better execution plan, the data analysis efficiency will be greatly improved.

### Query federation 
  - DorisDB allows direct access to data from Hive, MySQL and Elasticsearch without importing.

### Efficiently update 
  - The updated model of DorisDB can perform upsert/delete operations according to the primary key, and achieve efficient query while concurrent updates.

### Intelligent materialized view 
  - The materialized view of DorisDB can be automatically updated during the data import and automatically selected when the query is executed.

### Standard SQL 
  - DorisDB supports standard SQL syntax (TPC-H and TPC-DS). It is also compatible with the MySQL protocol. Various clients and BI software can be used to access DorisDB.

### Unified batch and streaming 
  - DorisDB supports batch and streaming data import. Data sources such as Kafka, HDFS and local files can be imported smoothly.

### High availability 
  - DorisDB supports multi-replica data storage and multi-instance data deployment. The cluster has the ability of self-healing and elastic recovery. 

### High scalability
  - DorisDB adopts a distributed architecture which supports the scale-out of storage capacity and computing power. The cluster can be expanded to hundreds of nodes, and support 10PB data storage.
 
 
## Use Case
Dorisdb can meet a variety of analysis needs, including OLAP analysis, custom reports, real-time data analysis, ad hoc data analysis, etc. Specific business scenarios include:

* OLAP analysis
* Real time data analysis
* High concurrency query
* Unified analysis
